I have chosen to use Processing as I have never used d3.js before so it seemed like the logical option for beginners.

I have created a landscape, using triangles, ellipses and rectangles. Those are the polygons.
The sun has eyes that are points and rays that are made of lines. The smile is made from an arc.
All of these elements have different colors.

To run the code, I have included the .pde file in the main directory which can be opened in Processing by pressing the run button in the sketch menu.
I also included an .exe file under the folder 'applicatin.windows64', called 'assignment0.exe' which can be used to run the sketch.

Thank you for your time and enjoy!
